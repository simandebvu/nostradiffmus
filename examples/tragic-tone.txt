         THE PROPHECY OF DOOM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Hark! I peer into the abyss of your commit,
And lo, darkness stirs within...

⚡ A race condition sleeps in asynchronous shadows,
   Waiting for the precise moment to awaken.

⚡ Promises made but not kept—error paths abandoned,
   Like a bridge half-built over turbulent waters.

⚡ State that shifts beneath your feet,
   Mutable and shared, a recipe for chaos.

The threads of execution shall intertwine,
And in their dance, data shall be corrupted.
What works in solitude shall fail in concert.

⚠ Likely Bug Category: Async Race Conditions

🧠 Advice: Review promise chains and shared state updates. You've introduced new async operations that access shared state without proper synchronization. Consider using locks or ensuring state updates are atomic. Check if error boundaries handle rejected promises correctly.

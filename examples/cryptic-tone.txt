        WHISPERS FROM THE VOID

The oracle speaks in riddles...

🌙 "When two paths diverge in the quantum wood,
    And both claim truth simultaneously,
    Which shall your user see?"

🌙 "The shadow knows what the light forgot—
    State exists in superposition until observed,
    But observation changes the observer."

🌙 "Seven tests deleted, seven seals broken,
    Coverage falls like autumn leaves,
    What remains untested shall manifest."

The pattern is clear to those who see.
The bug is already written.
It awaits only execution.

⚠ Likely Bug Category: State Drift

🧠 Advice: Watch for state synchronization issues between components. Your changes to state management logic may cause UI and data layer to diverge. Ensure derived state is recalculated when dependencies change.

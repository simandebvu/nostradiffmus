   THE BOOK OF VALIDATIONS, CHAPTER 3
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

And lo, it came to pass that the developer,
In their haste to ship before the weekend,
Did modify the validation logic,
Without testing the edge cases thereof.

✝ Verse 1: "Thou shalt not assume thy inputs are clean,
   For users are creative, and chaos eternal."

✝ Verse 2: "The empty string and null are not the same,
   Though many treat them as one, to their peril."

✝ Verse 3: "At the boundaries lie the demons—
   Zero, negative one, MAX_INT, and undefined.
   Test ye these, or suffer the consequences."

✝ Verse 4: "For every validation removed,
   A bug report shall be filed.
   This is the law, and the law is just."

Verily I say unto thee:
Your validation logic hath gaps,
Through which bugs shall creep.

⚠ Likely Bug Category: Validation Edge Cases

🧠 Advice: Your validation changes may miss edge cases like empty strings, null, undefined, or boundary values. Test with: empty inputs, very large inputs, special characters, and type coercion scenarios.

📊 Confidence: 71%

Amen. 🙏

🔮 Consulting the sacred diff scrolls...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    OH BOY, HERE WE GO AGAIN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Well, well, well... look what we have here.

🙄 You deleted tests. Bold strategy.
   I'm sure those edge cases were just being paranoid anyway.

🙄 Added new functions without test coverage?
   What could possibly go wrong?
   (Narrator: Everything.)

🙄 Refactored core logic on a Friday afternoon?
   Living dangerously, I see.

🙄 No regression tests for the old behavior?
   Hope your users enjoy surprise features!

Look, I'm not saying this WILL break production.
I'm just saying I've seen this movie before,
and it doesn't end well.

⚠ Likely Bug Category: Test Coverage Gaps

🧠 Advice: You've refactored core logic but haven't updated tests accordingly. The deleted test cases may have been covering important edge cases. Add tests for the new code paths and ensure refactored logic maintains the same contracts.

📊 Confidence: 88%

P.S. - That confidence score? Yeah, I'm that sure you'll regret this. 😏
